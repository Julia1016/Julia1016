## Week 1 - Introduction and Setup  
I have downloaded several software and registered succeefully
understanding the function of the software


### Evidence 
*Here you can include pictures of what you have done, you must also include any code that you have done, especially if you have been working on Arduinos or Raspberry Pis*

```c 
int code = 1; //If there is code this week, you must include evidence of it. 

if (code == 1){ 
    print("You will get marks for it");
}
else{
    print("You will not get marks for it if you don't include it");
}
```
### Weekly Conclusion 
*The summary of the first week is to download several professional software and have a basic understanding of the use of the software. In this week's homework, GIT software has been used to make things. I hope it can run perfectly in next week's course and get more knowledge and resources.In addition, if you encounter any problems in course homework, you should ask the teacher in time to solve the problems*

## Week 2 - Basic Electornic Components 



### Evidence 
*week 2-Basic Electornic Components

```c 
int code = 1; //If there is code this week, you must include evidence of it. 

if (code == 1){ 
    print("You will get marks for it");
}
else{
    print("You will not get marks for it if you don't include it");
}
```
### Weekly Conclusion 
*This week, I learned the connection of circuit diagrams and drawing circuit diagrams by fritzing. In class, the teacher gave us some wires, small light bulbs and electric boards for us to connect. The purpose was to make the small light bulbs light up. Finally, we succeeded. After class, use the software to make the circuit diagram, then take the screenshot of the schematic diagram, and finally put it in the logbook to complete the homework*
